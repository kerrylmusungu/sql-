Question:
Retrieve the product_name, unit_price and a column named "PriceCategory" that categorizes products into three groups: "Low", "Medium", and "High" based on their price ranges. Use the following criteria:

1. "Low" for products with price less than 200.
2. "Medium" for products with price between 200 and 500.
3. "High" for products with price greater than 500.

Table: products 

ColumnName          DataType
product_id          int
product_name        varchar 
category            varchar
unit_price          decimal

Solution:
SELECT product_name, unit_price,       
    CASE WHEN unit_price < 200 THEN 'Low'
    WHEN unit_price >= 200 AND unit_price <= 500 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'High'
    END AS PriceCategory
        FROM products;
