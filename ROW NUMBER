Question:
Retrieve the top 3 orders with the highest order_amount values, along with their order_id, customer_id, order_date and order_amount. Additionally, assign a unique row number as "row_num"  to each of these orders based on the descending order of order_amount values. 

Hint: Use LIMIT to restrict results to 3 rows

Table: orders

ColumnName      DataType
order_id        int
order_date      date
order_amount    decimal
customer_id     int
order_status    varchar
shipping_address   varchar

Constraints:
The input table orders contains valid data.

Solution:
SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY order_amount DESC) AS row_num,
    order_id, 
    customer_id, 
    order_date,
    order_amount, 
        FROM orders
            LIMIT 3;
