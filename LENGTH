Question:

Table: customers

ColumnName          Datatype           
customer_id         int 
customer_name       varchar
age                 int 
city                varchar

order_date      date
order_amount    decimal
customer_id     int
order_status    varchar

Constraints:
The input tables (customers and orders) contain valid data.

Solution:
SELECT
    customers.customer_id, customers.customer_name,
    orders.order_id, orders.order_date, orders.order_amount
    FROM 
        customers
        JOIN  orders
            ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
                WHERE (LENGTH(customers.customer_name)-1)%2 = 0;
                -- minus 1 because there is a space between names in the column customer_name
